# bobsgame-fonts
Fonts created for use with [bob's game](https://github.com/bobsgame/bobsgame). All fonts are ordinary Unicode fonts for use with non-OpenType-savvy programs (e.g. Haansoft Hangul NEO).
* **BobsGame Big** – The big version of normal font based on the font used in Mario & Luigi RPG games for the Nintendo DS. This font was created in 2012-12-20.
* **BobsGame Mono** – A monospaced font based on the OS/2 font “System VIO”. The OS/2 subset of this font was created in 2015-01-08. In OS/2 computers that use the default IBM TrueType Font Engine, the glyphs are decreased by one pixel. Use the FreeType font engine to fix the glyph spacing.
* **BobsGame nD** – This font is similar to the one used in Pokémon Diamond & Pearl (2008), Platinum (2009) and HeartGold & SoulSilver (2010) games.
* **Pixel Sans** – Based on the font used in many Nintendo 3DS, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS games. This font was created in 2015 under the name of **DS Sans**.
* **Pixel Sans Fallback** – Will be used in Japanese and Korean versions when the [game author](https://github.com/robertpelloni) implemented the translatable version code.
* **Pixel Sans Terminal** – An alternate version with all the lowercase letters changed to match the font used in SC UniPad (2006). LG provides different drawings for some characters, used only in Korean-only smart phones from the mid-2000s.
* **Pixel Sans Tetrid** – An alternate version with some uppercase and lowercase letters changed for use with Tetrid's user interface.
* **Pixel Sans Textbook** – This font is similar to the one used in the Western and Korean versions of Pokémon Black & White (2011). Capital J has a serif in which the original in-game font does not have.

## NFTR Installation Instructions
The NFTR for Pixel Sans Textbook font includes partial coverage of CP1252. The only characters missing in the NFTR is the non-breaking space, florin and small tilde. Use [Tinke](https://github.com/pleonex/tinke) to replace the font file.
1. Open up the European ROM for More English Training.
2. In the common/fonts/data folder, you'll see a file called **European_LC12.NFTR**.
3. Press **Change file** to replace the file.
4. Press **Save ROM** to save the ROM in a new name.
5. Test the font in the saved ROM using flash cards (e.g. TTDS) or in emulators (e.g. NO$GBA).

**Note:** The NFTR can only be applied to the European version of More English Training (EIGODUKE). Applying this to the Japanese or Korean versions of this game will make the game unbootable.
